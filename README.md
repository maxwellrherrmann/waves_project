# Wave Simulation
Final project for Computational Physics

## Dependencies

## Features

## How to use
Should be able to do something like
```python main.py --xbc neumann --ybc dirichlet ...```
etc. Definitely needs 
```python main.py --help```
and it might be nice to allow the user to run this from a fixed configuration file
```python main.py --config config.json```
